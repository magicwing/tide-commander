# 🌊 Tide Commander

RTS/MOBA-style Claude Code agents commander. Deploy, position, and command multiple Claude Code instances on a strategic battlefield.

## 💡 Why Tide Commander?

Working on large projects often requires juggling multiple tasks simultaneously - exploring the codebase, implementing features, fixing bugs, and writing tests. Tide Commander lets you spin up multiple Claude Code agents, each focused on a specific task or area of your project, and manage them all from a single visual interface.

Think of it like having a team of AI developers at your command. 🤖 Assign one agent to investigate a bug while another implements a feature. Watch them work in real-time, send follow-up commands, and keep your project moving forward on multiple fronts.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **3D Battlefield** - Visual command center with Three.js
- 🎯 **RTS Controls** - Click to select, right-click to move, number keys for quick selection
- 📡 **Real-time Activity Feed** - Watch your agents work in real-time
- 🤹 **Multi-Agent Management** - Spawn and control multiple Claude Code instances
- 💾 **Session Persistence** - Agents resume their Claude Code sessions across restarts

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- Claude Code CLI (`claude` command available in PATH)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the application
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser (or your configured `VITE_PORT`) and you're ready to go! 🎉

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Deploy an agent** - Click the **+ New Agent** button ➕
2. **Configure it** - Give it a name and choose a working directory 📁
3. **Select it** - Click on the agent in the 3D view or press 1-9 👆
4. **Send commands** - Type your task in the command bar and press Enter ⌨️
5. **Watch it work** - The activity feed shows real-time progress 👀
6. **Send follow-ups** - Agents maintain context, so you can have ongoing conversations 💬

You can spawn multiple agents, each working in different directories or on different tasks. Switch between them by clicking or using number keys.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 1-9 | Select agent by index |
| Escape | Deselect / Close modal |
| Alt+N | Spawn new agent |
| Enter | Send command (when input focused) |

## 🔧 How It Works

### Overview

Tide Commander provides a visual interface for managing multiple Claude Code CLI instances simultaneously. Each "agent" you spawn is a real Claude Code process running in the background, and you can send commands to them and watch their output in real-time.

### Core Components

**🖥️ Frontend (React + Three.js)**
- 3D battlefield where agents are visualized as characters
- WebSocket connection to receive real-time updates
- Command input for sending tasks to agents
- Activity feed showing what each agent is doing

**⚙️ Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- REST API for agent CRUD operations
- WebSocket server for real-time event streaming
- Process manager that spawns and controls Claude CLI instances

**🤖 Claude CLI Integration**
- Each agent runs `claude` with `--output-format stream-json`
- Events (tool usage, text output, errors) are parsed from stdout
- Commands are sent via stdin in stream-json format
- Sessions are persisted and can be resumed

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Browser (Three.js)            │
│  - 3D battlefield visualization         │

│  - Command interface                    │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘

                  │ stdin/stdout (stream-json)
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐

│  - Each agent = Claude CLI process      │
│  - Events streamed via JSON output      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Storage

**Server State** is saved to `~/.local/share/tide-commander/`:
- `agents.json` - Agent configurations (name, position, session mapping, token usage)
- `areas.json` - Drawing areas synced from the frontend
- `supervisor-history.json` - Agent supervisor history

**Claude Conversations** are read from `~/.claude/projects/`:
- Claude Code stores session files as JSONL (one JSON object per line)
- Directory names encode the working directory path (e.g., `/home/user/project` → `-home-user-project`)
- Tide Commander reads these to resume sessions and display conversation history

## ⚙️ Configuration

Ports can be configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 5174 | Backend server port |
| `VITE_PORT` | 5173 | Vite dev server port |
| `TIDE_SERVER` | `http://localhost:$PORT` | Server URL for hooks |

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Run client only
bun run dev:client

# Run server only
bun run dev:server

# Run both concurrently
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Agent stuck in "working" status**
- The Claude process may have died unexpectedly
- Refresh the page - status sync runs on reconnect
- Check server logs for errors

**"Claude Code CLI not found"**
- Ensure `claude` is in your PATH
- Run `which claude` to verify installation

**WebSocket disconnects**
- Check that the server is running (default port 5174, or your configured `PORT`)
- Look for CORS or firewall issues
